I try to categorize religions and traditions using the general cultural consensus about them. For example, although I would personally not consider Baha'i an Abrahamic religion, my understanding is that *they* consider *themselves* an Abrahamic religion, so I've categorized them as Abrahamic.

Unless otherwise stated, all lists are in alphabetical order.

My understanding of these categories and how I'm using them in these lists are as follows:

- **Abrahamic**: traditions stemming from the faith of Abraham from the Bible.
- **Dharmic**: traditions that originated on the Indian subcontinent, especially if they share core concepts like karma, dharma, and samsara.
- **Folk**: traditions practiced almost exclusively in a particular region or by a particular ethnicity, especially if they don't appropriately fit in any other category.
- **Pagan**: traditions that don't appropriately fit in any other category especially if they involve: a reverence for nature, polytheism, and beliefs like the divine being present in the natural world and a focus on natural cycles.
- **New-Religious Movements and New-Age Traditions**: traditions that began in the last 100 years or so (to the best of my knowledge).
- **Cults**: traditions that are high-control, manipulative, secretive, and generally toxic or otherwise harmful.
